# xaf_Security_EFCoreWithBlazorServer_NET5
IÂ´ve followed the guide in the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1q4GqFgSFE)

First of all, theres a complete sample wich uses XAF Security, Blazor Server along with XPO (https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/XAF_Security_E4908/tree/master/XPO/ASP.NetCore/Blazor.ServerSide?utm_source=DevExpress&utm_medium=Website&utm_campaign=XAF&utm_content=XAF_Security_NonXAF_Series_6_Blazor_ServerSide)

Following the youtube video and comparing the results with the complete sample, we can conclude the video covers only the very basics... (not even the login is in it)
